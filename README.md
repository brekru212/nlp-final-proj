# nlp-final-proj
Final project for cs4120 NLP
This repo is the source of code and data I used for my final project in College. 

Here you will find code that takes in news sources, 10k documents, and stock prices to predict future earnings reports.

The code uses various NLP techniques like topic modeling, sentiment analysis, etc... and comes up with a score that is then used with the other information to come to a "BUY, SELL, OR HOLD" decision.
